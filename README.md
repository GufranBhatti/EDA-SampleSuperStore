# Project Title
EDA on SampleSuperStore dataset
# Project Description
It is my internship task at The Sparks Foundation where I have to perform Expolatory Data Analysis (EDA) on SampleSuperStore dataset. My task was to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profits and what all problems you can derive from exploring the data. So using tableau, I created some worksheets (profit ratio by geography, key performance indicator, profit ratio by city, sales by category) and add them to create a dashboard. The dashboard visually represent where profits are in negative and work is needed to be done.

# How to contribute to project
More EDA could be done on this dataset and could dive more into the data and find some more interesting observations.
